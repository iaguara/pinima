- [Îagûara][iaguara/iaguara]


## Installation

Clone this repository and insert the code below into your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```shell
export PINIMA_HOME="$HOME/.pinima"
[ -s "$PINIMA_HOME/pinima.sh" ] && \. $PINIMA_HOME/pinima.sh
```

*Changes `PINIMA_HOME` to the path chosen when cloning this repository.*

The `bin` folder is added in your `$PATH` variable exposing some commands
to your shell.

*Ensure that `docker` is managed as a
[non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)*


## The APP structure

```
  app-name/
            |- rootfs/
            |- Dockerfile
            |- Makefile
```

The `rootfs` is optional, used to copy files to the root of the image
file system (the path `/` inside image).

The `Dockerfile` is optional, used only when we want to generate
a new Docker image (the `Makefile` must have a `build` task).

The `Makefile` contains tasks to build and run the app.
